      a bit about my programming journey, what attaracted me to founders and coders, and why i am applying for the course:<div>
      </div>
      <br>
      1. hello! im milena, a multimedia artist and budding programmer. before the pandemic i created interactive installation that encouraged people to play and forget about their worries. then covid happened and like everyone else i was stuck indoors, with my laptop as a means of entertainment  - i began to explore how i can move my practice to the digital sphere?<div>
      </div><br>
2. that's when i discovered computer programming and became obsessed! i enjoyed it so much i decided to seek a career in the field and started gaining certifications through free code camp. instead of making sculptures, i became motivated by writing and designing useful code for people to use<div>
      </div><br>
3. one of my main objectives is creating safe spaces in tech for queer people - i would like to create games and vr environments that are inclusive and progressive - queer spaces made for queer people by queer people<div>
      </div><br>
4. founders and coders was highly recommended to me by a friend of an alumni as a great place to advance my programming skills, as well as have a better chance of landing a great job in tech, and starting a meaningful career<div>
      </div><br>
5. finally - i'd like to meet new people with similar interests and create really interesting projects!<div>
      </div><br>
